=============

A complete, portable, Unicode dynamic string library for C.

LibAleph was primarily designed to provide functionality for a higher level scripting language that needed extensive string manipulation support. However, it has since expended to become a generic string library. Aleph string can, at any time, be safely passed to any other API that expects a regular `const char *` null-terminate string.
